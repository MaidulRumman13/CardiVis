            <h1>Heart Disease</h1>
            <p class="text-light">
                Heart disease, widely known as Cardiovascular disease (CVD), is the leading cause of death globally,
                killed approximately 17.9 million people each year, accounting for over 32% of all fatalities. Coronary
                heart disease, cerebrovascular illness, rheumatic heart disease, and other heart and blood vessel
                problems are all classified as CVDs. Heart attacks and strokes account for four out of every five CVD
                fatalities, with one-third of these deaths occurring before the age of 70. According to the American
                Heart Association's Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update:
                <br>
                ## Hypertension affects 116.4 million individuals in the United States, or 46%. These are some of the
                results from the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
                <br>
                ## Every 38 seconds, someone dies from cardiovascular disease. According to 2016 estimates, there are
                around 2,303 CVD fatalities every day.
                <br>
                ## A stroke kills someone every 3.70 minutes on average. According to 2016 data, there were 389.4 stroke
                fatalities each day.
                <br><br>
                Heart disease can sometimes be "silent," with no indications or symptoms until a person has a heart
                attack, heart
                failure, or arrhythmia. Symptoms that may occur as a result of these occurrences include.
                <br><br>
                ## Chest pain or discomfort, pain in the upper back or neck, indigestion, heartburn, nausea or vomiting,
                excessive exhaustion, upper body discomfort, disorientation, and shortness of breath are all symptoms of
                a heart attack.
                <br><br>
                ## Fluttering sensations in the chest are known as arrhythmia (palpitations).
                <br><br>
                ## Shortness of breath, weariness, or swelling of the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, or neck veins are all
                symptoms of heart failure.

            <h4>Chest Pain</h4>
            <p class="text-light">
                There are four different forms of chest discomfort that people might feel.
                <br>
                (1) Typical Chest Pain: Typical (classic) chest pain is defined as first substernal chest pain or
                discomfort that is secound triggered by physical activity or emotional stress and third eased by rest or
                nitroglycerine (or both).
                <br><br>
                (2) Angina: Angina is a form of chest discomfort caused by a reduction in cardiac blood flow. Angina is
                a symptom of coronary artery disease.
                <br>
                Squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness, or discomfort in the chest are common symptoms of angina,
                commonly known as angina pectoris. Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort that might feel
                like pressure, squeezing, burning, or fullness.
                <br><br>
                (3) Non-anginal pain: Non-anginal pain is a word used to describe chest discomfort that is not caused by
                heart disease or a heart attack. Non-cardiac chest discomfort is usually caused by an oesophageal issue,
                such as gastroesophageal reflux illness. Muscle or bone disorders, lung illnesses or diseases, stomach
                issues, stress, anxiety, and depression are some of the other reasons.
                <br><br>
                (4) Asymptomatic: Asymptomatic heart attacks, also known as silent myocardial infarction (SMI), account
                for 45-50 percent of cardiac morbidity and even premature mortality in India each year. Males are twice
                as likely as females to acquire SMI among middle-aged persons. Because the symptoms of SMI are so minor
                compared to those of a heart attack, it is known as the "silent killer." Unlike the signs of a typical
                heart attack, which include severe chest pain, stabbing pain in the arms, neck, and jaw, abrupt
                shortness of breath, perspiration, and dizziness, the symptoms of SMI are fleeting and commonly
                misdiagnosed as ordinary discomfort.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Electrocardiogram(ECG)</h4>
            <p class="text-light">
                An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a basic test that checks the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.
                The electrical impulses produced by your heart each time it beats are detected by sensors placed to your
                skin. ECGs (electrocardiograms) and EKGs (electrocardiograms) are two terms for the same thing. However,
                ECG has certain limitations. It monitors heart rate and rhythm, but it doesn't always reveal artery
                obstructions.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>ST segment /heart rate slope (ST/HR slope)</h4>
            <p class="text-light">
                The ST/heart rate slope (ST/HR slope), which measures the ST segment shift in relation to
                exercise-induced increases in heart rate, has been proposed as a more reliable ECG criteria for
                identifying severe coronary artery disease (CAD).

            <br>
            <h4>Cholesterol</h4>
            <p class="text-light">
                Cholesterol is a waxy molecule that may be present in your bloodstream. Cholesterol is required by your
                body to produce healthy cells, but excessive cholesterol levels might raise your risk of heart disease.
                <br>
                You might have fatty deposits in your blood vessels if you have high cholesterol. These deposits
                eventually accumulate to the point that blood flow through your arteries is restricted. Sometimes, such
                deposits might rupture unexpectedly and create a clot that causes a heart attack or stroke.
